### 1. Data Fetching & Parallel Processing
- **Multi-API Key Support** — Paste multiple Polygon keys (one per line or comma-separated) to bypass free tier constraints.
- **Parallel Chunking** — The backend automatically splits historical date ranges across all available keys for concurrent fetching.
- **Batched Option Lookups** — Options bars are fetched via round-robin key assignment. Rate limits are exactly managed (batch sizes and delays are configurable in settings).
- **Multi-Source Abstraction** — `DataFetcher` supports yfinance (default), Alpha Vantage, and Tiingo for strategy backtesting.
- **Data Quality Checks** — Automated pre-execution validation detects missing dates, stale prices, extreme returns, survivorship bias, duplicate timestamps, and weekend data.

### 2. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Analysis
- **Independent or Synced Fitting** — Fit N components independently to Time-at-Price (D1) and Volume-Weighted (D2) distributions, or use "Sync D1/D2" to find the universally best shared N minimizing combined BIC.
- **Label-Stable Moment Evolution** — Track how each Gaussian component's Mean, Volatility (σ), and Probability Weight drift over time via a sliding window. Uses **Mahalanobis-distance matching** between windows to prevent discontinuous jumps when component ordering shifts in sklearn's GMM optimizer.
- **Re-Analyze** — Change bins or the maximum/desired components via the themed sliders and instantly re-run the math without re-fetching underlying candles.

### 3. Volatility Engine (Locally Computed)
- **Black-Scholes Pricing** — Full implementation with continuous dividends handling call/put greeks analytically.
- **Implied Volatility Tracking** — Brent root-finding for IV calculation mapped to a 3D Volatility Surface.
- **Tenor-Matched VRP** — Volatility Risk Premium computed at specific tenors (10d, 20d, 30d) using inverse-distance-weighted ATM IV. Each VRP directly compares IV at that tenor vs the corresponding realized vol.
- **Metrics Dashboard** — 25Δ Put-Call Skew (fear premium), VRP, Term Structure, and Parkinson high-low volatility estimators.

### 4. BKM Model-Free Risk-Neutral Moments
- **Bakshi-Kapadia-Madan (2003) Engine** — Extracts variance, skewness, and kurtosis directly from OTM option prices via Simpson's-rule integration. No distributional assumption required.
- **Dual Tenor Extraction** — Computes moments at both 30-day and 60-day horizons.
- **RN vs Physical Comparison** — Dedicated BKM Panel shows side-by-side risk-neutral (BKM from options) vs physical (GMM from price history) moments with color-coded mispricing alerts.
- **Actionable Insights** — Flags when the market is pricing more downside than the physical distribution suggests (expensive puts), or when tail options are overpriced/underpriced.

### 5. Trade Signal Generation
Evaluates real-time math thresholds against the enriched options chain to output actionable strategies. All signals include **transaction cost adjustments** using bid-ask spreads (or a 3% mid-price haircut as fallback):

1. **Vol Crush** — When VRP > 5%, sell short strangles to capture premium.
2. **Skew Trade** — When 25Δ Put Skew exceeds GMM tail risk, sell put credit spreads.
3. **Calendar Spread** — When term structure inverts (backwardation), sell near / buy far.
4. **Mean Reversion** — When price displaces from primary High Volume Nodes, buy directional options.
5. **Gamma Scalp** — When GMM distribution is distinctly multi-modal, buy straddle + delta-hedge.

Each signal reports `estimated_execution_cost` for full transparency on spread drag.

### 6. Caching & Merging System
- **Raw-Only Cache** — Session data (candles, option contracts, closed bars) saves locally as `.json`. No computed data is exported, ensuring purity.
- **Instant Restore** — Uploading a cache file skips all API hits and immediately recomputes GMM and options greeks.
- **Merge Tool** — Dedicated MERGE tab lets you drag-and-drop multiple cache files. It intelligently dedupes overlapping candles (by timestamp) and contracts (by ID) to synthesize larger continuous datasets.

### 7. Strategy Lab & Walk-Forward Engine
- **Zero Look-Ahead Bias** — Upload custom Python code for regime detection and allocation. The engine executes day-by-day, ensuring logic strictly receives `t-1` historical data.
- **Built-in Templates** — Fast-start with pre-configured strategies including Gaussian HMM Regime Switching, Dual MA Momentum, and simple Volatility thresholding.
- **Interactive Animator** — Animate walk-forward P&L alongside an overlaid historical price chart, dynamically shaded by active regimes with scrubbing and speed controls.
- **Strict Sandboxing** — The Python code evaluator strips dangerous built-ins and uses AST parsing to rigidly lock down imports to secure numerical libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, sklearn, hmmlearn).

### 8. Quantitative Tearsheet & Reports
- **Full Tearsheet** — Post-backtest analytics comparable to pyfolio/quantstats: CAGR, Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Omega, Tail Ratio, VaR (historical, parametric, Cornish-Fisher), CVaR, Ulcer Index, drawdown table, monthly return heatmap, rolling metrics, and benchmark comparison (alpha, beta, info ratio, up/down capture).
- **Monte Carlo Simulation** — Block bootstrap (21-day blocks to preserve autocorrelation) with 10,000 paths. Reports confidence intervals for terminal wealth, max drawdown, and probability of loss. Fan chart visualization.
- **PDF Report Export** — One-click professional PDF generation with equity curve chart, key metrics table, and drawdown analysis via ReportLab + matplotlib.

### 9. Parameter Sensitivity & Walk-Forward Optimization
- **Grid Sweep** — Sweep over any parameter range (e.g., `rebalance_days`, `transaction_cost`) and visualize how strategy performance varies via 3D surface plots and heatmaps.
- **Walk-Forward Optimization** — Splits data into N folds of rolling train/test windows. For each fold: optimizes parameters in-sample, evaluates out-of-sample. Stitches OOS equity curves for unbiased composite performance.
- **Multi-Strategy Comparison** — Run multiple strategies or configs, compare side-by-side with overlaid equity curves and pairwise return correlations.

### 10. Strategy Library & Persistence
- **SQLite Database** — Strategies, run history, and sessions are persisted in a local SQLite database (`voledge.db`).
- **Strategy CRUD** — Save, load, update, fork, and delete strategies. Tag and search your library.
- **Run History** — All backtest executions are logged with configs, metrics, and duration for auditability.

### 11. Dynamic UI/UX
- **Tab-Based Navigation** — 15 dedicated tabs: CHARTS, PROFILE, VOL, BKM, SIGNALS, DATA, MOMENTS, STRATEGY, LIBRARY, TEARSHEET, COMPARE, SENSITIVITY, WFO, ANIMATE, MERGE.
- **Collapsible Sidebar** — The Controls sidebar is draggable/resizable (200px–450px) and collapses into a micro-icon strip to maximize chart space.
- **Configuration Hub** — A header gear icon ⚙ opens Settings for tweaking batch variables (requests vs delay), option expirations (near/far boundaries), and sliding window ratios.
- **Theming** — Fully unified dark-mode styling with natively customized WebKit range sliders (`#3b82f6` accents). Font stack: JetBrains Mono for data, DM Sans for UI.

## Limitations & Notes

- **Free Tier Rate Limits**: Polygon allows 5 calls/min per key. The settings menu defaults ensure you stay exactly within this limit (`Batch Size`=5, `Delay`=61s). Providing multiple keys automatically scales throughput linearly.
- **Options Data Limitations**: The free tier provides *daily* closing option bars. Real-time intraday bid/ask spreads require a paid Polygon tier. Transaction cost estimates use a 3% mid-price haircut when bid/ask is unavailable.
- **BKM Requirements**: Model-free risk-neutral moments require ≥3 OTM calls and ≥3 OTM puts within the target DTE bucket. Broader strike ranges or deeper chains improve accuracy.
- **IV Accuracy**: Black-Scholes inherently prices European options. For American equity options, there is a minor early-exercise discrepancy, but BS serves as the standard approximation.
- **Signal Disclaimer**: Generated signals are mathematical indicators derived purely from statistical anomalies (VRP, Skew, KDE multimodality). They are **not** investment advice.
